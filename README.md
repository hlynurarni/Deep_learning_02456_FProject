# 02456 Deep learning Final Project

This is a repository for the final project in the course 02456 Deep learning taken at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU). The project is about generalization in video games using deep reinforcement learning. Experiments were conducted using the procedurally generated [Procgen](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.01588.pdf) environments.

A very useful code for setup and bookkeeping was given by the supervisor and, then a [proximal policy optimization algorithm](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.06347.pdf) implemented. Attempting to improve generalization, inspiration and code was heavily pulled from [Reinforcement Learning with Augmented Data](https://github.com/MishaLaskin/rad), [Improving Generalization in Reinforcement Learning with Mixture Regularization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.10814.pdf) and [Training Procgen environment with Pytorch
](https://github.com/joonleesky/train-procgen-pytorch)


Notebook inclduing the code to recreated the results can be seen in this [link](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/hlynurarni/Deep_learning_02456_FProject/blob/master/Notebooks_turnin/PPO_notebook_combined.ipynb). If there is interest to see the jupyter notebook file it can be found [here](https://github.com/hlynurarni/Deep_learning_02456_FProject/blob/master/Notebooks_turnin/PPO_notebook_combined.ipynb).
